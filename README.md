# My Personal Project
*Bernard Liu - Phase 0 Proposal*

## Brief Description of Program

The program I want to create is going to be a store managing simulator game. The premise
of this game is that you are running some general store. The tasks you will perform will include:
- scanning customer items
- making bargains with customers if they want a discount (random)
- learning the cashier system ui (this will probably be implemented in later phases)
- perform some admin tasks (purchasing and checking inventory etc.)

The point of this game is to achieve a high score, you do this by getting through as
many customers in the day, making successful bargains, and making it as far as possible
without going negative in profit. As soon as you go negative the game ends. 

## Target Audience

Anyone that wants to play the game.

## Why this Interests Me

I was a cashier before and I think I can make a realistic simulator. Also, I have worked with
pretty terrible cashier systems and am convinced I can make a better one
than the company I worked for (in terms of user interface).

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to checkout the items of the customer
- As a user, I want to be able to see a list of my high scores
- As a user, I want to purchase goods for my store and manage inventory
- As a user, I want to see my score and store balance
